# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

Please note that as opposed to the whiteboard design session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members working on the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Cloud Workshop: Modern Cloud Apps lab is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with additional team members to more closely model a real-world experience, and to allow members to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Exercise 1: Proof of concept deployment

Duration: 60 minutes

Contoso has asked you for a proof of concept in Microsoft Azure by deploying the web, database, and API applications for the solution as well as validating that the core functionality of the solution works. Ensure all resources use the same resource group previously created for the App Service Environment.

### Task 1: Deploy the e-commerce website, SQL Database, and storage

In this exercise, you will provision a website via the Azure **Web App + SQL** template using the Microsoft Azure Portal. You will then edit the necessary configuration files in the starter project and deploy the e-commerce website.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 1: Configure SQL Database Firewall and Retrieve Connection String

1. Navigate to the Azure Management portal, [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com/), using a new tab or instance and login with your lab-provided Azure credentials.

2. Navigate to the **contososports-01** resource group.

3. Select the **ContosoSportsDB** SQL Database.

    ![The contososports Resource Group blade with the "ContosoSportsDB" highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image22.png "Azure Portal")

4. On the **SQL Database** blade, select the **Show database connection strings** link.

    ![On the SQL Database blade, in the left pane, Overview is selected. In the right pane, under Essentials, the Connection strings (Show database connection strings) link is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image23.png "SQL Database blade")

5. On the **Database connection strings** blade, select and copy the **ADO.NET** connection string. Then, save it in **Notepad** for use later, being sure to replace the password placeholder with **demo@pass123**

    ![In the Database connection strings blade, the ADO.NET connection string is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image24.png "Database connection strings blade")

6. Go back to the **contososports-01** resource group blade, and select the **contososports[Suffix]** SQL Server.

    ![The contososports resource group with the contososports sql server highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/2019-11-15-17-47-46.png "Azure Portal")

7. On the **Overview** screen of the **SQL Server** blade, select the **Show firewall settings**.

    ![On the SQL Server Overview screen with the Show firewall settings link highlighted.](media/2019-03-31-14-37-31.png "SQL Server Overview")

8. On the **Firewall Settings** blade, specify a new rule named **My IP**, copy your **Client IP address**, and paste it into the **Start IP** and **End IP**. This will set the allowed IP Address range to just your IP address so you can connect to the database from this machine.

    ![Screenshot of the Rule name, Start IP. and End IP fields on the Firewall Settings blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image27.png "Firewall Settings blade")

9. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Firewall settings Save button.](media/2019-04-10-16-00-29.png "Firewall settings Save button")

10. Update progress can be found by selecting the **Notifications** link located at the top of the page.

    ![Screenshot of the Success dialog box, which says that the server firewall rules have been successfully updated.](media/2019-04-19-13-39-41.png "Success dialog box")

11. Close all configuration blades.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 2: Retrieve Storage Account Access Keys

1. Go back to the **contososports-01** blade resource group, and select the **contoso[Suffix]** Storage account.

2. On the **Storage account** blade, scroll down, and, under the **SETTINGS** menu area, select the **Access keys** option.

    ![In the Storage account blade, under Settings, Access keys is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image35.png "Storage account blade")

3. On the **Access keys** blade, click on **Show keys** then select the copy button by the **Connection String** field in the **key1** section. Paste the value into **Notepad** for later usage. 

    ![In the Access keys blade default keys section, the copy button for the key1 connection string is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image36.png "Access keys blade, default keys section")

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 3: Retrieve Service Bus Queue Connection String

1. Go back to the **contososports-01** blade resource group, and select the **contososervicebus[Suffix]** Service Bus Namespace.

    ![Service Bus Namespace resource is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-38-09.png "Service Bus Namespace")

2. Select the **Queues** link under Entities.

    ![Queues link under Entities](media/2020-03-18-10-38-57.png "Queues link")

3. On the **Queues** pane, select the **receiptgenerator** Service Bus Queue.

    ![receiptgenerator queue is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-40-40.png "receiptgenerator queue is highlighted")

4. On the **receiptgenerator** Service Bus Queue blade, select the **Shared access policies** link under Settings.

    ![Shared access policies link is shown](media/2020-03-18-10-42-03.png "Shared access policies link is shown")

5. Select the **Publisher** shared access policy.

    ![Publisher policy is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-43-12.png "Publisher policy is highlighted")

    >**Note**: The _Publisher_ and _Listener_ shared access policies for the Azure Service Bus Queue were deployed as part of the ARM Template that was used to setup the lab environment. As you can see, the **Publisher** policy that we're copying the connection string for, only has permissions to _Send_ messages to the queue.
    >
    > By default, no policies are created. Additionally, it is best practice to use least privilege security to create separate shared access policies for publishers sending messages and listeners receiving messages from the queue. 

6. On the **SAS Policy** pane, copy the **Primary Connection String**. Paste the value into **Notepad** for later usage. 

    ![Primary Connection String is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-54-39.png "Primary Connection String is highlighted")

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 4: Create secrets in Azure Key Vault

You've retrieved multiple access keys and connection strings in this task. To properly secure them, and to keep these values out of application code, we need a secure place to store them. This place is the Azure Key Vault.

1. Go back to the **contososports-01** resource group blade, and select the **contosokv[Suffix]** Key Vault resource.

    ![The resource listing is displayed with the key vault item selected.](media/rg_selectkeyvault.png "Resource group listing")

2. Beneath **Settings**, select **Access Policies**.

3. In order to add, edit, or view secrets, you must be granted access through a new Access policy. Select the **+ Add Access Policy** link.
    
    ![A portion of the Access Policies screen is shown with the + Add Access Policy link selected.](media/add_access_policy_link.png "Key Vault Access Policies")

4. Expand the **Secret permissions** drop down, and check the **Select all** checkbox.

5. For **Select principal**, select your Azure user account, and select **Add**.

    ![The Add access policy form is displayed with the Secret Permissions and Select principal fields highlighted.](media/kv_add_access_policy_form.png "The Add Access Policy Form")

6. Press **Save** on the **Access policies** screen to save the changes.

7. Beneath **Settings**, select **Secrets** then **Generate/Import**.

8. Create the following secret values by filling out **Name** and **Value** (retaining the defaults for all other fields):

    | Name | Value |
    |------|-------|
    | AzureQueueConnectionString | {the primary connection string you recorded for the queue} |
    | ContosoSportsLeague | {the database connection string} |
    | contososportsstorage | {the primary connection string you recorded for the storage account} |

    ![The Create a secret form is displayed with the Name and Value fields highlighted.](media/kv_createasecret.png "The Create a secret form")

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 5: Centralize secrets for multiple projects using an App Configuration store

The Contoso Sports solution contains multiple projects, each of which access the same Azure resources. In this subtask, we will be centralizing the configuration of the solution applications via the deployed Azure **App Configuration** resource.

1. Go back to the **contososports-01** resource group blade, and select the **contosoconfig[Suffix]** App Configuration resource.

    ![The resource listing is displayed with the App Configuration resource highlighted.](media/appconfig_resourcelist_selection.png "The resource listing")

2. Select **Configuration explorer** found beneath the **Operations** section of the left menu.

3. On the **Configuration explorer** screen, expand **+ Create** and select **Key Vault reference**.
   
   ![The + Create button is expanded with the Key Vault reference item highlighted.](media/ac_createkeyvaultreference_menu.png "Create Key Vault Reference")

4. On the **Create** form, be sure to select the appropriate **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and the **contosokv** Key Vault. Create the following Key Vault references:

    | Key | Secret | Secret version |
    |-----|--------|----------------|
    | ConnectionStrings:ReceiptQueue | Select **AzureQueueConnectionString** | Select **Latest version** |
    | ConnectionStrings:ReceiptStorage | Select **contososportsstorage** | Select **Latest version** |
    | ConnectionStrings:SportsDB | Select **ContosoSportsLeague** | Select **Latest version** |

    ![The Create new Key vault reference form is displayed populated with the ConnectionStrings:ReceiptQueue values.](media/ac_createkeyvaultref_form.png "The create new key vault reference form")

5. From the left menu, select **Access keys** located in the **Settings** section.

6. Select the **Read-only keys** tab. 

7. Copy the **Primary key Connection string** value, and paste it into notepad. This value is needed to connect the deployed applications to the App Configuration store. 
    
    ![A portion of the Access keys screen is displayed. The Read-only keys tab is highlighted and the copy button next to the Primary key Connection string textbox is selected.](media/ac_connectionstringcopy.png "The Access keys screen")

5. Repeat step 4-6, this time installing the latest **Azure.Identity**.

6. Now we are ready to configure this application to use the App Configuration in Azure. Under the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project, open the **Program.cs** file.

7. Uncomment the following **using** statements at the top of the file:
    
    ```C#
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Azure.Identity;
    ```

8. In the **CreateHostBuilder** method, uncomment the following code - this tells the application to utilize the AppConfig connection string that you've already setup on the **contosoapp** application service to point to the centralized App Configuration resource.
    
    ```C#
    webBuilder.ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        var settings = config.Build();

        config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
        {
            options.Connect(settings["ConnectionStrings:AppConfig"])
                    .ConfigureKeyVault(kv =>
                    {
                        kv.SetCredential(new DefaultAzureCredential());

4. For **Version**, select **Recommended**. Select **Create**.

5. The Name determines the profile editing policy name used by your application. For example, enter **SSPR**.

6. Under Identity providers, select **Reset password using email address**.

7. In the **Multifactor authentication** section, ensure **MFA enforcement** is set to **Conditional**.

8. In the **Conditional Access** section, uncheck the **Enforce conditional access policies** checkbox.

9. In the **Application claims** section, select the **Show more** link at the bottom of the checklist box.

10. In the **Return claim** column, choose attributes about the user that are returned to the application in the token.

    For now, select the following:

    - **Email Addresses**
    - **Given Name**

11. Select **OK**.

12. Select **Create**. Observe the policy just created appears as \"**B2C\_1\_SSPR**\" (the **B2C\_1\_** fragment is automatically added) in the **Profile editing policies** blade.

13. Open the policy by selecting **B2C\_1\_SSPR**, then **Run user flow**.

14. Select **Contoso B2C application** in the **Select Application** drop-down.

15. Select **Run user flow**. A new browser tab opens, and you can run through the profile editing consumer experience in your application.

### Task 6: Modify the Contoso.App.SportsLeague.Web

1. Expand the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project. Find the **Startup.cs** code file, locate the `public void ConfigureServices(` method declaration, then add the following line of code to the bottom of this method:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI.AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddAzureADB2C(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureADB2C", options));
    ```

    ![The Startup.cs file with the "app.UseAuthorization();" line of code highlighted.](media/2019-04-19-15-08-40.png "Startup.cs")

2. Add the following `using` directives to the top of the **Startup.cs** code file:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI;
    ```

3. Locate the `app.UseAuthorization();` line within the `public void Configure` method, and add the following line of code before it:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAuthentication();
    ```

    The result will look similar to the following:

    ![app.UseAuthentication code inserted.](media/2020-03-18-14-44-13.png "app.UseAuthentication code inserted")
    
4. **Save** the file.

5. Locate the Azure AD B2C name by navigating to your resource group. Copy the name to Notepad.

    ![List of all of the resources within the ContosoSports resource group. Pointing to the B2C tenant name.](media/2019-03-28-16-51-14.png "Locate B2C tenant name")

6. Next, using the Azure Management Portal, using your main subscription, open the Contoso Web App blade, and select **Configuration**.

7. Add the following settings in the **Application Settings** section:

   - AzureADB2C:Instance - `https://[your Azure AD B2C name].b2clogin.com/tfp/`
   - AzureADB2C:ClientId - **B2C Application ID you copied down earlier**.
   - AzureADB2C:CallbackPath - `/signin-oidc-b2c`
   - AzureADB2C:Domain - **[your Azure AD B2C name].onmicrosoft.com**
   - AzureADB2C:SignUpSignInPolicyId - `B2C_1_SignUp`
   - AzureADB2C:ResetPasswordPolicyId - `B2C_1_SSPR`
   - AzureADB2C:EditProfilePolicyId - `B2C_1_EditProfile`

8. Select **Save**.

### Task 7: Send authentication requests to Azure AD

Your app is now properly configured to communicate with Azure AD B2C by using ASP.NET Core Identity. OWIN has taken care of all of the details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session. All that remains is to initiate each user's flow.

1. Right click on the **Controllers** folder, and select **Add** -\> **Controller**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, in the right-click menu for the Controllers folder, Add is selected, and from its menu, Controller is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image177.png "Solution Explorer")

2. Select **MVC Controller -- Empty** and then select **Add**. Replace default name of **HOmeController1.cs** with the name of **AccountController.cs** for the new Controller being added.

    ![On the left of the Add Scaffold window, Installed / Controller is selected. In the center of the window, MVC 5 Controller - Empty is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image178.png "Add Scaffold window")

3. Add the following using statement to the top of the controller:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

4. Locate the default controller **Index** method.

    ![The Default controller method Index is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image179.png "Default controller method Index")

5. Replace the method with the following code:

    ```csharp
    // Controllers\AccountController.cs

    private string _editProfilePolicyId;

    public AccountController(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _editProfilePolicyId = configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureADB2C:EditProfilePolicyId");
    }

    public ActionResult SignIn()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult SignUp()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult Profile()
    {
        if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
                var properties = new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" };
                properties.Items[AzureADB2CDefaults.PolicyKey] = _editProfilePolicyId;
                return Challenge(
                    properties,
                    AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult SignOut()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
        string redirectUri = Url.Action("Index", "Home", null, Request.Scheme);
        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties
        {
            RedirectUri = redirectUri
        };
        return SignOut(properties, AzureADB2CDefaults.CookieScheme, AzureADB2CDefaults.OpenIdScheme);
    }
    ```

6. Save the file.

### Task 8: Display user information

When you authenticate users by using OpenID Connect, Azure AD returns an ID token to the app that contains **claims**. These are assertions about the user. You can use claims to personalize your app. You can access user claims in your controllers via the ClaimsPrincipal.Current security principal object.

1. Open the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs** file and add the following using statements at the end of the other using statements at the top of the file:

    ```csharp
    using Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web.Models;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

2. Still in the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs** file, add the following method to the **HomeController** class and save the file.

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    public ActionResult Claims()
    {
        var displayName = User.Identity.Name;
        ViewBag.DisplayName = displayName;
        ViewBag.Claims = User.Claims;
        return View();
    }
    ```

3. You can access any claim that your application receives in the same way. A list of all the claims the app receives is available for you on the **Claims** page. In Visual Studio on the Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web object, right-click on folder **Views -\> Home,** select **Add -\> View**, choose **Razor View - Empty** and name it **Claims.cshtml**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu for Views\\Home, Add is selected, and from its menu, View is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image180.png "Solution Explorer")

4. Open the **Claims.cshtml** file and replace the code with the following and **Save** the file.

    ```csharp
    @using System.Security.Claims
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = "Claims";
    }
    <h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

    <h4>Claims Present in the Claims Identity: @ViewBag.DisplayName</h4>

    <table class="table-hover claim-table">
        <tr>
            <th class="claim-type claim-data claim-head">Claim Type</th>
            <th class="claim-data claim-head">Claim Value</th>
        </tr>

        @foreach (Claim claim in ViewBag.Claims)
        {
            <tr>
                <td class="claim-type claim-data">@claim.Type</td>
                <td class="claim-data">@claim.Value</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </table>
    ```

5. Right-click on the **Views -\> Shared** folder, select **Add**, add a new **View**. Choose **Razor View - Empty** and **\_LoginPartial.cshtml** for the name.

    ![In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu for Views\\Shared, Add is selected, and from its menu, View is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image180.png  "Solution Explorer")

6. Add the following code to the razor partial view to provide a sign-in and sign-out link as well as a link to edit the user's profile and **Save** the file.

    ```html
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <text>
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                <li>
                    <a id="profile-link">@User.Identity.Name</a>
                    <div id="profile-options" class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                        <ul class="profile-links">
                            <li class="profile-link">
                                @Html.ActionLink("Edit Profile", "Profile", "Account")
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Sign out", "SignOut", "Account")
                </li>
            </ul>
        </text>
    }
    else
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Sign up", "SignUp", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "signUpLink" })</li>
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Sign in", "SignIn", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })</li>
        </ul>
    }
    ```

7. Open `Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml` in Visual Studio. Locate the header-top div, and add the line that starts with `@Html.ActionLink` and the line that starts with `@Html.Partial` and **Save** the file.

    ```html
    <div class="header-top">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="header-top-left">
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a>
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a>
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a>
                </div>
                <div class="header-top-right">
                    <a href="#" class="top-wrap"><span class="icon-phone">Call today: </span> (555) 555-8000</a>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Claims", "Claims", "Home")
                </div>
                @Html.Partial("_LoginPartial")
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

### Task 9: Run the sample app

## Exercise 5: Automating backend processes with Azure Functions and Logic Apps

Duration: 45 Minutes

Contoso wants to automate the process of generating receipts in PDF format and alerting users when their orders have been processed using Azure Logic App and Functions. To run custom snippets of C\# or node.js in logic apps, you can create custom functions through Azure Functions. [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) offers server-free computing in Microsoft Azure and are useful for performing these tasks:

- Advanced formatting or compute of fields in logic apps

- Perform calculations in a workflow

- Extend the logic app functionality with functions that are supported in C\# or node.js

### Task 1: Create an Azure Function to Generate PDF Receipts

1. Open the Azure Management Portal (<http://portal.azure.com>).
   
2. Select the **+ Create a resource** tile, then select **Compute \> Function App**. Select **Create** button at the bottom.

    ![The New resource screen is shown with Compute and Function app selected.](media/newcomputefunctionapp.png "Create function app in the Portal")
   
3. Provision and deploy the new function app, with the following settings:

    - **Resource Group**: Use the existing resource group, **contososports-01**.

    - **Function App name**: _Choose a unique name_.

    - **Publish**: Select **Code**.

    - **Runtime Stack**: Select **.NET Core**.
    
    - **Version**: Select **3.1**.

    - **Region**: _Choose the same region used for the e-commerce web apps in this lab_.

4. Select **Next: Hosting >**.

### Task 3: Create an Azure Logic App to Process Orders

Without writing any code, you can automate business processes more easily and quickly when you create and run workflows with Azure Logic Apps. Logic Apps provide a way to simplify and implement scalable integrations and workflows in the cloud. It provides a visual designer to model and automate your process as a series of steps known as a workflow. There are [many connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list) across the cloud and on-premises to quickly integrate across services and protocols.

The advantages of using Logic Apps include the following:

- Saving time by designing complex processes using easy to understand design tools

- Implementing patterns and workflows seamlessly, that would otherwise be difficult to implement in code

- Getting started quickly from templates

- Customizing your logic app with your own custom APIs, code, and actions

- Connect and synchronize disparate systems across on-premises and the cloud

- Build off BizTalk server, API Management, Azure Functions, and Azure Service Bus with first-class integration support

## Exercise 6: Automate deployments using GitHub actions

Duration: 30 minutes

The Contoso Sports League would like to move their existing source control to GitHub. In addition to this, they wish to implement automatic deployments of their projects into production. The desired workflow is that features are developed in their own branch and once complete, pull requests are issued to the master branch. The pull requests are then reviewed for quality assurance, and once approved, the pull request is then merged into the master branch of the repository. Upon this merge, the projects in the solution should be automatically released into the production Azure environment using the code from the master branch. In this exercise, you will learn how to deploy code to Azure from GitHub Actions in two different ways: via a Service Principal created in Active Directory, as well as via Application Service Publish Profiles.

### Task 1: Create a GitHub repository

1. Open a web browser, and navigate to <https://www.github.com>. Log in using your GitHub account credentials.

2. In the upper-right corner, expand the user drop down menu and select **Your repositories**.

    ![The user menu is expanded with the Your repositories item selected.](media/github_yourrepositoriesmenu.png "GitHub user menu")

3. Next to the search criteria, locate and select the **New** button.

    ![The GitHub Find a repository search criteria is shown with the New button selected.](media/github_newbutton.png "New repository button")

4. On the **Create a new repository** screen, name the repository **ContosoSports** and select the **Create repository** button.

    ![The Create a new repository screen is shown with the Repository name set to ContosoSports and the Create repository button is highlighted.](media/github_createrepositoryform.png "Create a new repository form")

5. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository, paste this in notepad for future use.

    ![The Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](media/github_copygithuburl.png "The quick setup screen")

### Task 2: Commit the existing lab files to source control

1. Open a command prompt and change directory to the folder that contains the lab files solution file (Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.sln).

2. At the command prompt, issue the following command to initialize the git repository:

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

3. Set the remote origin to the GitHub Url from the previous task by executing the following command (replace the URL with your own):

   ```shell
   git remote add origin <your GitHub Url>
   ```

4. Commit the initial code, and push it to the master branch by issuing the following commands:

    ```shell
    git add -a
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git push -u origin master
    ```

### Task 3: Create a service principal in Active Directory

One method to deploy code using GitHub actions is to create a Service Principal that has the necessary access to deploy the web applications in the solution. In this exercise, we will be releasing the Call Center Admin Portal application using this service principal. This service principal is created in Azure Active Directory, and is granted the Contributor role to the deployed lab resources, scoped by the resource group.

1. In the Azure portal, select the icon to open the Cloud Shell located on the top toolbar.

    ![A portion of the Azure Portal top toolbar is displayed with the Cloud Shell menu item highlighted.](media/azureportal_cloudshellmenuitem.png "The cloud shell taskbar item")

    > **Note**: You may be prompted to create a storage account to support cloud shell activities, this is required in order to utilize the cloud shell.

2. Obtain the Subscription ID and Resource Group name by opening the resource group where you have deployed all of the applications in this lab. The Subscription ID is available in the Overview pane.

3. In the Cloud Shell, execute the following to create the service principal scoped by the resource group we've been using in this lab (replace Subscription ID and resource group name):

    ```PowerShell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name 'mcw-modern-cloud-apps' --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource Group Name> --sdk-auth
    ```

4. This will output a JSON data result, copy and paste this result and save it for a future step in this lab.

    ![The output of the previous command is displayed with the JSON result highlighted.](media/azurecloudshell_serviceprincipaljson.png "JSON output in the cloud shell")

### Task 4: Create repository secrets

You have the ability to add secrets to the repository in GitHub. Secrets contain sensitive information that should never be checked into source control. These secrets are kept encrypted by GitHub and are made available to GitHub actions through the **secrets** collection (which you will see in the next task). We will be creating many secrets, as we have five projects that we are configuring for auto-deployment.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 1: Create the service principal credentials secret

1. In GitHub, return to the **ContosoSports** repository screen and select the **Settings** tab.

2. From the left menu, select **Secrets**.

3. Select the **New secret** button.

   ![The Settings tab of the ContosoSports repository is shown with the Secrets menu item and the New secret button highlighted.](media/github_newsecretbutton.png "GitHub repository settings")

4. In the New secret form, enter the name **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**, and for the value, paste in the JSON data obtained when creating the Service Principal in the previous task. Select **Add secret**.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 2: Create the e-commerce web application publish profile secret

1. In the Azure Portal, open the e-commerce web application service, it is the one named contosoapp{randomcharacters}.

2. From the top toolbar of the App Service screen, select **Get publish profile** item. This will download a file. Open this file in a text editor.

    ![On the App service screen, the Get publish profile button is highlighted on the toolbar menu.](media/azureportal_appservice_getpublishprofile.png "Get Publish profile")

3. Return to the ContosoSports repository GitHub Secrets screen, and add a new secret named **AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE**, for the value, paste the contents of the publish profile from the previous step, then select the **Add secret** button.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subtask 3: Create publish profile secrets for the remaining projects

Repeat Subtask 2 for the remaining projects by obtaining the publish profiles from the Azure Portal. Create the secrets as follows:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| AZURE_API_PAYMENT_PUBLISH_PROFILE | Contents of the publish profile for the Payments API |
| AZURE_API_OFFERS_PUBLISH_PROFILE | Contents of the publish profile for the Offers API |
| AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE | Contents of the publish profile for the Receipt Function Application |

![The GitHub repository secrets screen is displayed with a table containing all the secrets added in this lab.](media/github_secretslisting.png "GitHub repository secrets")

### Task 5: Define the production deployment workflow

1. In the web browser, return to the ContosoSports repository on GitHub, and select the **Actions** tab.

    ![On the ContosoSports repository screen, the Actions tab is selected.](media/github_actionstab.png "Repository Actions")

2. Beneath the **Get started with GitHub Actions** heading, select the **set up a workflow yourself** link.

3. Above the editor, name the workflow **productiondeployment.yml**. Remove all code in the file editor.

    ![The Actions workflow editor is displayed with an empty code listing with the name productiondeployment.yml highlighted.](media/github_actions_namedandempty.png "The Actions workflow editor")

4. Copy and paste the following workflow to the text editor. The code is documented inline.

    ```yml
    name: Contoso Sports Production Deployment

### Task 6: Trigger the Production Deployment Workflow

In this task, we will be making a modification to the e-commerce web application in a branch and issuing a pull request to the master branch. We will manually merge the pull request into the master branch to trigger the production deployment workflow.

1. Open a command prompt, and change directory to where the Visual Studio solution file is found.

2. Execute the following commands to create a branch for this modification. Keep this command window open.

    ```shell
    git pull
    git branch textchange
    git checkout textchange
    ```

3. In Visual Studio, expand the e-commerce website project (Web/Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web), and edit and save the **Views/Home/Index.cshtml** file.

    ![The code listing for Views/Home/Index.cshtml is shown with some modified text highlighted.](media/visualstudio_edithomeindex.png "Visual Studio file editor")

4. Return to the command window, and execute the following commands to commit the text change to the branch.

    ```shell
    git commit -am "Changed some text"
    git push --set-upstream origin textchange
    ```

5. In a web browser, return to the ContosoSports source code repository.

6. Above the file listing table, you should see a notification that **textchange had recent pushes**. Select the **Compare &amp; pull request** button.

    ![The textchange had recent pushes notification is shown with the Compare and pull request button highlighted.](media/github_compareandpullrequest.png "Recent push notification")

7. On the **Open a pull request** form, feel free to write a comment, and select the **Create pull request** button.

8. You should now see a message indicating that there are no conflicts with the base branch.

    ![A message indicating there are no conflicts is shown.](media/github_pullrequest_noconflicts.png "No conflicts on the branch")

9. Select the **Actions** tab of the repository to verify that the deployment workflow has not been triggered by the recent file commits on the textchange branch.

10. Return to the pull request that was just created, by selecting the **Pull requests** tab, and selecting the pull request in the list.

11. Select the **Merge pull request** button on the pull request, then select **Confirm merge**.

12. Return to the **Actions** tab, and you should see that the workflow has been triggered (merging pushes new code to the branch, thus the production workflow is triggered).

    ![The workflows list is displayed with an in progress workflow that has been triggered by the merge of the pull request.](media/github_mergeworkflowtriggered.png "Workflow in progress")

13. Once the deployment workflow has completed. Navigate to the E-commerce web application and ensure the changes you made are visible.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1. Since the HOL is now complete, go ahead and delete all the Resource Groups that were created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

2. In GitHub, open the ContosoSports repository and select **Settings**. Scroll to the bottom of the screen, and select the **Delete this repository** button in the **Danger Zone** section.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
